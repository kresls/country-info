# Country Info

- React App
- User can search for a country and then receive various "widgets" with information/data related to the chosen country
- Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## APIs

Currently using the following APIs:

- [REST Countries](https://restcountries.eu/)
- [Nager.Date](https://date.nager.at/)
- [MetaWeather](https://www.metaweather.com/api/)

## To do

- Add styling
- Add further "widgets"
  - Maybe following:
    - Outlined country from Google Maps
    - Twitter trends in country
    - Weather in capital city
    - Popular tourist destinations
    - Some form of average salary or similar
- Fix imports of components
  - Proper directories and index.js files
